This is my personal plan9port configuration. It should work in all
platforms supported by plan9port.

To install just do:


	$ cd $HOME
	$ git clone https://github.com/xmonk/p9p.git .p9p

Then add the following to your .bashrc:

	if [ -d $HOME/.p9p ]; then
		. $HOME/.p9p/rc
	fi

	$ . $HOME/.bashrc
	$ ./.p9p/install    # Optional.

If you're using macOS the install script will install Acme.app and
Sam.app in $HOME/Applications. It will download and install a few useful tools from github.com.
