# Plan9port Configuration

This is my personal plan9port configuration. It works across all platforms supported by plan9port.

## Installation

```bash
$ cd $HOME
$ git clone https://github.com/xmonk/p9p.git .p9p
```

Then add the following to your `.bashrc`:

```bash
if [ -d $HOME/.p9p ]; then
    . $HOME/.p9p/rc
fi
```

Apply the changes and optionally run the install script:

```bash
$ . $HOME/.bashrc
$ ./.p9p/install    # Optional
```

## macOS-specific Features

If you're using macOS, the install script will:
- Install Plumb.app, 9term.app, Acme.app and Sam.app in /Applications
- Download and install useful tools from GitHub
- Generate a LaunchAgent for acme-lsp (if installed)

## Using acme-lsp with the `alsp` Command

The `alsp` command provides a convenient interface for managing acme-lsp:

```bash
$ alsp -h    # Show help and available options
```

Common operations:

```bash
$ alsp -L    # Load the acme-lsp launch agent
$ alsp -s    # Start acme-lsp (requires acme to be running)
$ alsp -t    # Check if acme-lsp is running
$ alsp -T    # View recent log entries
$ alsp -o    # Show paths to log files
```

You can also use other options like `-S` to stop the service, `-r` to restart it, and `-c` to truncate log files.

The configuration ensures log directories exist when starting the service, making it easier to manage your acme-lsp environment.
