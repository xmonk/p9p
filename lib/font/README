Add your custom fonts to this directory. You'll need to use the -f flag when calling
Acme or you can add the following to $HOME/.p9p/rc

export font=$HOME/.p9p/lib/font/some_font.font

If you use the p9acme script then you can also add the following to $HOME/.p9p/rc:

export font=$HOME/.p9p/lib/font/some_font.font
export fixed=$HOME/.p9p/lib/font/some_fixed_width.font
