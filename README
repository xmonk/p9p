This is my personal plan9port configuration. It should work in all platforms
supported by plan9port. To install just do:

	cd $HOME
	git clone https://github.com/xmonk/p9p.git .p9p

Then add the following to your .bashrc:

	if [ -d $HOME/.p9p ]; then
		. $HOME/.p9p/rc
	fi

	. $HOME/.bashrc

All should be good to go. If you're using OS X then one more step to install
Acme.app and Sam.app.

	./.p9p/osx.install

Now you'll be able to use Acme, Sam, and 9term like any other mac app.
